- Use "+k8s:" as tag prefix
  - openapi-gen currently uses "+k8s:validations" so we need to do work there too
- Pick location for validator library
  - k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/validation introduces risk of drift if someone uses code-generator and a different rev of apimachinery
- Fix subresources
  - "spec" and "status" are hard coded in generator, drive them off of a `+subresource=status` tag?
  - Do we need to do anything special for "scale"?
- When calling a validation function in another pkg, we need to make sure it exists
  - by name convention + fingerprint
  - by explicit tag (e.g. // +validation-func-for=...
- ValidateUpdate support [LARGE CHANGE!]
  - Plumb oldObject in through all the validation calls
  - Define how update validators are authored (CEL transition rules have explored WHEN a update rule should trigger)
- Warning support
  - Decide how to implement
- Ratcheting support?
  - Do we need to do anything with feature gate awareness?
  - Some handwritten validations take options params that guide validation behavior. How to support?
- Stop using "+k8s:validation-gen=TypeMeta" to find root types
  - Stop generating validation for list types
- Add OpenAPI value validation
  - Size limits (+min{Length,Properties,Items}, +max{Length,Properties,Items})
  - Numeric limits (+minimum, +maximum, +exclusiveMinimum, +exclusiveMaximum)
  - String formats (+format)
- Add metadata.name/generateName validation (+nameFormat?)
- Add required field validation (+optional)
- Add SMD/SSA validation (+listType, +listMapKey, +patchMergeKey, +patchStrategy)
- Add CEL validation rules
- Fix enum generator to generate refs to enum constants instead of string literals.  Also generate a sets.Set for each enum?
- Deduplicate `jsontagutil.go`. It was copy-pasted in from applyconfig-gen
- Deduplicate most of enum.go, it was copy-pasted in from kube-openapi
- Add opt-in/opt-out controls
  - Ability to opt-out of declarative validation for:
    - type
    - field (and subfields)
    - specific tag(s)
- Migrate core group to declarative validation
  - xref: Alex's WIP for jobs: https://github.com/alexzielenski/kubectl-validate/blob/jobset/jobset/patches/apis/jobset.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2.json
  - Enable declarative validation for strategies and test
  - Migrate
    - enums
    - required field validation
    - SMD/SSA validation
    - OpenAPI value validation
    - metadata.name/generateName validation
    - unions
    - cross field validations
    - update validations
- Use Go-standard-style names for generated functions
- Add debug logging in generator
- Decide test regimen for validators lib
- Fix bug where generating apps API group enables enum generation on core API group
- Clear out 3 remaining "Migrate to declarative validator" TODOs in `pkg/apis/core/validation/validation_test.go`
  for scalar testing that should be put in declarative validator test code
- rename "disabled-tags" to "disabled-tag" and document as repeated
- don't build the same fieldpath over and over: `if fp := fldPath.Child("x"); true { call(fp, ...), call(fp, ...) }`
- Error when calling eachVal on non-list types.
- Don't emit functions for non-root-types with no transitive validations.
